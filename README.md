# snacks-crud-project

**Author:** Matthew Holder
**Version:** 0.1

[PR]()

## Problem Domain:

Build a snacks-crud-project which creates, stores, updates, and deletes snacks. Give each page the necessary links to be able to acces the parts of the website that page should reasonably have access to.

## Description:

In ListView, the snacks app lists all saved snacks.

In DetailView, the app describes the snack selected.

In UpdateView, the user can change the name, purchaser, and description of the selected snack. After a successful upate the user is redirected to ListView.

In DeleteView, the user can delete the selected snack.

In CreateView, the user can add a new snack by inputing the name of the snack, selecting the username of the purchaser, and description of the snack.

### Developer notes

Delete view not deleting snacks yet, but properly presents correct information.
